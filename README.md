# ProFake

ProFake is a hybrid model developed to detect fake Instagram accounts using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques. 
The model integrates KNN and LSTM algorithms with weighted fusion to improve detection accuracy. 
A Flask-based web interface allows users to interact with the model easily, while Pyngrok enables secure, local deployment.
